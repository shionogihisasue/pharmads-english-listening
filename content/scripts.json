      "level": "beginner",
      "category": "MDM",
      "text": "Master Data Management, or MDM, is a technology-enabled discipline that consolidates critical business data from multiple sources. In pharmaceutical companies like Shionogi, MDM ensures consistency of product, organization, and patient data across clinical trials, manufacturing, and regulatory submissions. Stibo Systems provides a multi-domain MDM platform that enables integrated management of various master data types.",

      "level": "advanced",
      "category": "Regulatory",
      "text": "GxP refers to Good Practice guidelines that ensure pharmaceutical products are safe, effective, and high quality. This includes Good Clinical Practice, Good Laboratory Practice, and Good Manufacturing Practice. Data systems used in GxP environments must undergo Computer System Validation, or CSV, to demonstrate they perform consistently and accurately. Maintaining GxP compliance requires robust data governance, audit trails, and electronic signature capabilities throughout the data lifecycle.",

      "level": "intermediate",
      "category": "Clinical Data",
      "text": "Real-world data, abbreviated as RWD, refers to data collected outside traditional clinical trials, such as electronic health records, insurance claims, and patient registries. Real-world evidence, or RWE, is the clinical insight derived from analyzing RWD. Pharmaceutical companies increasingly leverage RWD and RWE to support drug development, regulatory submissions, and post-market surveillance. Advanced analytics platforms enable researchers to extract meaningful patterns from vast amounts of real-world data.",
